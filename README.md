# MERN Address Book
MERN Address Book is a simple web application that allows users to manage their contacts. It uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts. It also allows users to search for contacts by name or mobile number.

## Prerequisites
To run MERN Address Book, you'll need the following:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
MongoDB (version 4.4 or higher)

```
Create a .env file in the server folder and add the following environment variables:
